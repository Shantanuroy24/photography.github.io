                    Yep, that’s right, when I started with professional photography I was NOT interested in wedding
                    photography.
                </p>
                <p class="main-para1">At the time I told myself it would be too much stress, that I’d have to deal with
                    those ‘bridezillas’ you hear so much about, and that I didn’t want to work an 8-hour day constantly
                    on my feet, with the usual wedding food being my only sustenance.</p>
                <p class="main-para2">I didn’t like the style of what I saw as wedding photography either. Light and
                    airy, overly-posed, editorial style perfect photos; or perfectly flash-lit, over-edited shots of a
                    bride and groom in an obviously fabricated embrace. Meh. Not for me.</p>
                <p class="main-para3">It took (reluctantly) photographing a friend’s wedding and attending a <span
                        class="para-sub1"> Killer Filler Workshop</span> for me to realise that <span
                        class="para-sub2">wedding photography can be fun</span> and isn’t stressful. It’s exciting and
                    uses SO many genres of photography all in one wedding day. </p>
                <p class="main-para4">Fun couples who are looking for alternative, unconventional wedding photography
                    want candid, natural, documentary-style photos, and they want portraits that capture their
                    personalities, not the most awkward, unnatural pose they could imagine. <span class="para-sub">Those
                        couples are my couples</span>. They don’t fit defined physical characteristics. It’s about being
                    the real you on one of the most important days, but also one of the most fun days, of your lives.
                </p>
                <p class="main-para5">If that sounds like you, the ones who don’t like their photos being taken, but
                    love to laugh at each other’s stupid jokes, then you should have <span class="para-sub3">filled in
                        my contact form by</span> now, because you’re already one of my couples.</p>

                    <p class="about-para1">As you’ve guessed by now, I’m an alternative, non-traditional (almost
                        anti-traditional), creative wedding photographer (a fellow photographer asked me if I was
                        coffee-powered, as I always have to start the day with a strong coffee… and it has stuck). </p>
                    <p class="about-para2">Wedding photography has taken me on incredible adventures across the UK,
                        Europe, and even the USA, from intimate elopements to epic wedding parties. In my four years of
                        capturing weddings, I've been honored with multiple awards for my creative work, including being
                        recognised as one of the International Top 100 Artistic Photographers in 2023. But hey, I don't
                        take myself too seriously - for me, it's all about having a blast and creating unforgettable
                        memories! </p>
                    <p class="about-para3">I spend a lot of time with you on your wedding day so I can tell your wedding
                        story through stunning photos, which is why it’s important I get to know you, and you get to
                        know me. I want you to feel comfortable and relaxed around me so that your personality can shine
                        through in the photos. I also know that every couple is unique and has their own style, which is
                        why I love to incorporate personal touches and details into my photography. So, let's create
                        some magic together and capture your special day in a way that truly represents you!</p>
